Files Preview as Thumbnails
Directory Thumbnail Generator for Images and Custom File Previews Based on Extensions

This Python application allows users to generate and preview thumbnails of files in a specified directory. It supports image file previews (e.g., .jpg, .png, .jpeg) and custom icons for other file types based on extensions (e.g., .mp3, .pdf, .txt). Built with Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI), the app provides a simple and intuitive way to browse files and view previews.

Features
Thumbnail Previews for Images: Automatically generates and displays thumbnail previews for image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, etc.).
Custom Icons for Other Files: Displays custom icons for non-image files based on their extensions (e.g., .mp3, .txt, .pdf).
Directory Browsing: Choose a directory and generate previews for all files contained within.
Installer Available: The application comes with an easy-to-use installer for quick setup and installation on Windows.
Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used for development.
Tkinter: Python library for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
Pillow (PIL): Python Imaging Library for image handling and thumbnail creation.
Custom Icons: Icons for non-image file types (e.g., audio, text files) based on extensions.

Customization Tips:
Installer: If you have a specific platform (e.g., Windows), provide a direct download link to the installer in the README or specify how users can get it.
Images or Screenshots: If possible, include a screenshot of the app in action to showcase the interface or how thumbnails appear in the directory.
Dependencies: Make sure your requirements.txt includes the necessary libraries (Pillow, Tkinter, etc.). For Tkinter, you might not need to install it separately on some systems, as it's often bundled with Python.
Usage: Feel free to expand the usage section with more detailed explanations or features, depending on the app's capabilities.
